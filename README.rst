Instructions for Introduction to Scientific Python
==================================================

**If you can't get this to work, you can do** `this class in  mybinder.org`_.

Installing Python
-----------------

- Students should have `Anaconda Python`_, python version 3.6, installed (64 bit is correct for any reasonably recent machine). **There won't be time to do this at the start of the short course!!!**

I will have an alternative live during the course, but it won't get your machine working!

- When doing this *also install Visual Studio Code*. It is an option near the end.

- Just install anything it asks you about.

- Users should install locally (not for all users) to keep things simple.

- All platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux) will be covered.

Platform Differences
--------------------

Windows Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Find the Anaconda Prompt application and run it.
- Type ``conda update --all``

Mac Users
~~~~~~~~~

- Find the ``Terminal.app``. It is located in your ``/Applications/Utilities`` folder.
  - Quick tip- command-key space-bar, then type 'Terminal' may launch it if Spotlight is set up correctly.
- Type ``conda update --all``

Linux Users
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Open your favorite terminal and type ``conda update --all``

Installing GitHub
-----------------

I will want you to get things during the course from `GitHub <http://github.com>`_.

- Download `GitHub Desktop`_ and install it. You may need to create an account on GitHub.

  Linux Users:

  You will need to use `GitKraken`_.

  - Good News: It's much more powerful
  - Bad News: It's much more complicated.

- Go to `the repository for this class in your web browser`_.
- You should be able to see a green button that says ``Clone or Download``. ``Clone`` is much better. This will allow you to update it in the future. Download means you reorganize each time. I suggest you create a folder ``GitHub`` in your Documents folder.

The rest will happen in class!
